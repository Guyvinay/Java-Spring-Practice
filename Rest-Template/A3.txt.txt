While Creating an API thing to consider:
   1. Security should be properly implemented with the API, Authentication, Authorization, role based authorization, JWT authentication etc,
   2. API endpoints should be briefly meaningful with needing less path variables,
   3. Handling edge cases, exceptions gracefully with proper message response,
   4. Provide Logging as well,
   5. Creating API documentation.

While Consuming an API thing to consider:
   1. Trying understanding the API documentation and have clearity regarding the endpoints,
   2. Handling errors,
   3. Authentication,
   4. Understanding the API response and consume accordingly.
